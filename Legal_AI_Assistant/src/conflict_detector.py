conflict_detector.py — Contract Clause Conflict Detection

Compares extracted clauses against each other to surface internal
contradictions — places where one part of the contract conflicts with
another part. These inconsistencies are a common source of disputes.

⚠️  IMPORTANT DISCLAIMER ⚠️
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
LLM-based conflict detection is NOT 100% reliable. The model may:
  • Miss conflicts that require deep legal domain expertise to spot.
  • Flag "conflicts" that are actually intentional or legally complementary.
  • Fail on highly technical or jurisdiction-specific language.

This tool helps you KNOW WHAT TO LOOK FOR and directs your attention to
potentially problematic areas. It is NOT a substitute for a qualified
attorney's review. Always verify flagged conflicts with a licensed lawyer
before making any legal or business decisions.
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Common conflict patterns this module targets:

  1. NOTICE PERIOD MISMATCH
     Termination clause: "30 days written notice required."
     Payment clause:     "Invoices are due 60 days after notice of termination."
     → You're legally required to pay for 60 days but can only terminate in 30.

  2. CONFIDENTIALITY vs DEFINITION CONFLICT
     Definition section: "Confidential Information means only written materials
                          marked CONFIDENTIAL."
     Confidentiality clause: "All information disclosed, including oral
                              communications, is confidential."
     → The definition is narrower than what the clause protects.

  3. TERMINATION vs AUTO-RENEWAL
     Termination clause: "Either party may terminate on 30 days notice."
     Auto-renewal clause: "This Agreement auto-renews annually unless notice
                           is given 90 days before expiry."
     → You need 90 days notice for auto-renewal but only 30 for termination —
       which governs if the contract expires and auto-renews in 35 days?

  4. IP OWNERSHIP vs CONFIDENTIALITY
     IP clause: "All work product is owned by Company and may be used freely."
     Confidentiality clause: "All work product is Confidential Information
                              and must not be disclosed."
     → Company claims ownership AND confidentiality — can they publish your work?

You are a legal contract analyst. Review the following extracted contract clauses
and identify any internal conflicts or contradictions between them.

Extracted clauses:
{clauses_json}

Look for conflicts such as:
- Different notice periods for the same event mentioned in two different clauses
- A definition that contradicts how a term is used elsewhere
- A termination clause that conflicts with an auto-renewal clause
- An IP ownership clause that contradicts a confidentiality clause
- Different liability caps stated in different sections
- Inconsistent governing law references

Respond with a JSON array. If no conflicts are found, return an empty array [].
